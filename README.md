# opendata-api-spec-compiled

This repository is used as a publishing endpoint for our deliverables:

* `opendata-swagger.json` - Swagger spec.

Plus JSON schemas for the following resources:

* ATM
* Branch
* PCA
* BCA
* SME Loan

Publishing occurs automatically, based on stable commits from the `opendata-api-spec` repository.
